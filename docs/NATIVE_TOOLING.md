# Native build tooling

The normal build has no C# or .NET dependency. Repository-owned host tools are
C++20 and compile natively on Linux.

## Division of responsibility

LLVM/Clang and lld handle the standard work that mature native tools already
solve: C/C++ compilation, archives, COMDAT, symbol resolution, TLS, unwind
records, and x86-64 relocations. The repository-owned converter handles only
PS5-specific output requirements:

- FreeBSD OS ABI 9, ABI version 2, and executable type `0xFE10`;
- execute-only, read-only, RELRO, writable, and flags-zero linking segments;
- process-parameter and parameter-block records;
- SDK import discovery from the installed public `.so` stubs;
- PS5 NIDs, module/library IDs, SysV hash, and dynamic tags;
- development FSELF wrapping and integrity metadata.

The converter reads imports directly from the PIE and the SDK stubs. It does
not contain a copied import catalog or firmware offsets.

Native third-party libraries are allowed when they solve a standard problem
and the build can acquire and link them reproducibly. zlib is used directly by
the FSELF tool; LLVM/lld handles standard object linking. This boundary keeps
the repository free of managed build tooling without reimplementing mature
native libraries such as zlib or OpenSSL. zlib 1.3.2 is downloaded from its
fixed upstream archive, SHA-256 verified, and compiled into `.deps/native/`;
the build no longer depends on a changing distribution package.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tooling/native/app_crt.cpp` | Native C++ process startup and constructor handling |
| `tooling/native/app_cpp_runtime.cpp` | Minimal `new`/`delete` bridge to `malloc`, `free`, and `posix_memalign` |
| `tooling/native/app-symbols.map` | Keeps replacement allocation operators internal to the application |
| `tooling/native/ps5-pie.ld` | Non-overlapping intermediate PIE layout |
| `tooling/native/elf_object.*` | ELF and SDK-stub reader |
| `tooling/native/sce_module_writer.*` | PS5 executable converter |
| `tooling/native/self_container.*` | FSELF reader, writer, and verifier |
| `tooling/native/libc_builder.cpp` | Deterministic clean-room runtime emitter |
| `tooling/native/hash.hpp` | Project-owned SHA-1/SHA-256 implementation |

## Build the host utility manually

The normal build invokes the dependency bootstrap automatically. To compile the
converter yourself, take the paths the bootstrapper prints rather than a global
library:

```bash
bash tools/setup-native-dependencies.sh
```

That prints `SDK_ROOT=`, `ZLIB_INCLUDE=`, and `ZLIB_ARCHIVE=` for the pinned
private zlib under `.deps/native/`. Pass those paths to the host compiler:

```bash
clang++ -std=c++20 -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Werror \
  -I "$zlib_include" \
  tooling/native/native_app_builder.cpp \
  tooling/native/self_container.cpp \
  tooling/native/elf_object.cpp \
  tooling/native/sce_module_writer.cpp \
  "$zlib_archive" -o build/host/ps5-native-tool
```

zlib is the only directly linked host library. `make` performs the same step
and installs the tool at `build/host/ps5-native-tool`.

## Target C++ profile

Application `.cpp` files compile as C++20 with exceptions and RTTI disabled.
The public SDK's libc++ headers provide zero-cost vocabulary types and
`std::unique_ptr`; the build does not link the full libc++, libc++abi, or unwind
archives. Repository-owned replacement allocation operators forward to the
clean-room runtime and are localized before PS5 conversion, so they do not
become loader-visible application exports.

Throwing `new` deliberately traps on allocation failure. Nothrow allocation
returns `nullptr`. Prefer value semantics and allocation-free RAII in steady
state, and do not introduce `std::shared_ptr`, streams, locale, filesystem,
exceptions, or RTTI without a separate runtime and firmware validation.

## Source quality

The repository uses the same focused Clang policy as the CPython PS5 project:
`make format-check` enforces `.clang-format`, while `make tidy` runs the Clang
core and security analyzers configured by `.clang-tidy`. `make lint` runs both
plus attribution, JSON, shell-syntax, local-path, and whitespace checks.

## Build performance

The heavy steps are the Mesa-derived archives, not the application. Measured
on the reference host (14 cores: four performance and ten efficiency, with an
NVMe filesystem), a forced rebuild with everything deleted costs:

| Step | Cold | Second forced rebuild |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PS5 shader compiler archive, 472 objects | 53 s | 1.8 s |
| Vulkan runtime, both targets | 16.5 s | 4.4 s |
| Driver, including the 480-source PIC archive | 75 s | 8.2 s |

Three things produce that shape:

- Every script keeps its objects beside the tree they came from, so a rebuild
  with no source change is already about a second.
- `tools/build-vulkan-runtime.sh` and `tools/build-driver.sh` build the PS5 and
  PC targets concurrently. Each target alone averaged five to six busy cores
  of fourteen; together they keep more of the machine working.
- The heavy archives use [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) when it is installed
  (`sudo pacman -S ccache`), keyed on preprocessed source and flags and stored
  in the ignored `.deps/ccache`. Set `PS5VK_DISABLE_CCACHE=1` to bypass it, or
  `CCACHE_DIR` to place the cache elsewhere. A cold run pays nothing
  measurable for it; the second forced rebuild replays cached objects.

Two ideas were measured and rejected, and are recorded here so they are not
retried:

- **A tmpfs build tree.** These builds are CPU-bound: the same Vulkan runtime
  build took 19.6 s on f2fs and 20.7 s on tmpfs, with the CPU busy at four to
  nine cores throughout. RAM disks beat slow filesystems, which is why the
  retired `/mnt/c` checkout compiled a title in 150 s against 9 s inside WSL;
  they do not beat an NVMe filesystem.
- **Compiling the shader-compiler archives without `-g`.** They are installed
  with debug information stripped, so it looked free, but the stripped output
  is not byte-identical (29,722,694 bytes against 29,732,190) and the recorded
  install digests are what shader-compiler titles are checked against. It saved
  11% of a 53 s build, which does not justify moving those bytes.

## Commands

```text
ps5-native-tool link --in <llvm-pie> --out <ps5-elf> --stub-dir <sdk-lib>
ps5-native-tool self --sign --in <ps5-elf> --out <fself>
ps5-native-tool self --extract --file <fself> --out <ps5-elf>
ps5-native-tool self --inspect --file <module>
```

`link` expects the repository linker script’s page-separated PIE. The normal
build invokes it correctly; the command is documented for debugging and CI.

## Current hardware-validation baseline

A clean build of the current C++20 graphical Hello World was deployed with
`make deploy`, launched, observed, and closed on firmware 6.02 and 12.70. The
exact tested artifacts are:

```text
Raw ELF SHA-256:  6198c82adf9d59f2ae14de4e1410e2482376afc9f9ee148f3d8cf406a952c0ff
FSELF SHA-256:    d791f65c5a62aec4d70c4e9c6b8b0baeeefbf51a41dd774287e1353f66af2966
Runtime SHA-256:  e6ff45d16adf687855cc3b33b0c8a4132b6504360b221e0a34c7e99fb3ba0036
```

On 6.02 the captured display showed the complete CPU VideoOut scene and the
packaged `/app0/assets/banner.txt` content. On both consoles klog recorded
native `eboot` execution without a loader, fatal-signal, or crash marker. The
12.70 run also recorded transition into `AppScreen`. Title-aware closure was
confirmed by ShadowMount/KStuff, and FTP, klog, and elfldr remained reachable
after both runs.

The loader-visible comment record and the unmapped trailing note intentionally
have zero memory size. Firmware 6.02 rejects those records before entry when
their file size is incorrectly copied into `p_memsz`; the static validator
enforces the tested convention.
